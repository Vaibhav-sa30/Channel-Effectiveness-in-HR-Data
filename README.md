# Channel Effectiveness in HR Data


### Task

After analyzing the data, write the ranks as per channel effectiveness (1 is the most effective, 4 is the least effective)

### Criteria

1. Channel-wise application count (total, weekly)/ avg number of appln incoming per week
2. Candidate Qualification across the channel -  (degree + experience)
3. Aging across the channel
4. Number of Shortlisted candidates across the channel
5. Number of applications matching JD and CV
6. Ease of applying

Since, 2nd, 3rd and 5th point do not hold much relevance, we'll avoid them in this analysis.
