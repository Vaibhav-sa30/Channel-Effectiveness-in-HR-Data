# Channel Effectiveness in HR Data

## What is Channel Effectiveness?

When a company is looking to hire new employees, they might use different channels to advertise job openings, such as:

- Company Website: Posting job listings directly on the company's official website.
- Social Media (Linkedin, Naukri.com, etc)
- Employee Referrals: Encouraging current employees to refer potential candidates.
- Recruitment Agencies (Third Party): Partnering with recruitment agencies to source candidates.

"channel effectiveness" refers to the evaluation of these recruitment or sourcing channels to determine which platforms, websites, or sources are generating the most job applications for a company's open positions.

Channel effectiveness analysis involves tracking and measuring metrics related to each channel's performance, such as:

- Application Volume: The number of applications received through each channel.
- Quality of Applicants: The suitability and qualifications of the applicants from each channel.
- Time to Fill: How quickly positions are filled from each channel.
- Cost per Hire: The expenses associated with sourcing and hiring from each channel.
- Conversion Rate: The percentage of applicants from each channel who progress to the interview stage or beyond.
- Diversity and Inclusion: Evaluating the diversity and inclusiveness of applicants from different channels.

### Task

Analyzing the data and write the ranks as per channel effectiveness (1 is the most effective, 4 is the least effective)

### Criteria

1. Channel-wise application count (total, weekly)/ avg number of appln incoming per week
2. Candidate Qualification across the channel -  (degree + experience)
3. Aging across the channel
4. Number of Shortlisted candidates across the channel
5. Number of applications matching JD and CV
6. Ease of applying

Since, 2nd, 3rd and 5th point do not hold much relevance, we'll avoid them in this analysis.
